  As with audio, until recently it was impossible to "comfortably" insert a video file into HTML markup. Since HTML5 there is a `<video>` element that, like `<audio>`, allows you to quickly add videos to a page.

  The `<video>`  tag is paired, which, in the absence of nested `<source>` tags, specifies the path to the video file in the `src` attribute. You can use the `controls` attribute to display controls for the video player. The visual appearance of the controls depends on the specific browser.

  ```html
  <video src="https://example.com/our-video.mp4" controls></video>
  ```

  By using special `<source>` tags, you can add multiple video formats. This is necessary because each browser can only play certain video formats. The only format that all browsers handle correctly is `mp4`.

  ```html
  <video controls>
      <source src="https://example.com/our-video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      <source src="https://example.com/our-video.webm" type="video/webm">
      <source src="https://example.com/our-video.ogg" type="video/ogg">
  </video>
  ```

  Three file formats ensure that videos work on all devices. You also need `type` attribute, which will tell the browser the format of the video. It's this attribute that the browser uses to decide which file to download.

  The `<video>` tag has several important attributes:

  * `controls` — Adds controls for the video player
  * `autoplay` — Automatic playback after loading the video
  * `width` — Width of the video playe
  * `height` — Height of the video player

  The `width` and `height` attributes are pixel values, and you don't need to specify the unit of measure.

  ```html
  <video width="500" height="500" controls>
      <source src="https://example.com/our-video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      <source src="https://example.com/our-video.webm" type="video/webm">
      <source src="https://example.com/our-video.ogg" type="video/ogg">
  </video>
  ```

instructions: |
  Add an mp4 video to the page:

  * Video link: https://www.w3schools.com/html/movie.mp4
  * The video player should have controls
  * Player height: 240
  * Player width: 320
  * Enter the path to the file in the `<video>` tag

  Turn your volume down just in case ;)

tips:
  - If only one file is used, it's enough to add the `src` attribute for the `<video>` tag. Otherwise use `<source>` tags
  - The `mp4` format is correctly handled by most browsers. If possible, it's best to use it.
